# Avalanche - Create and Mint Token

This project is a final assessment in Avalanche: Types of Functions - ETH + AVAX

## Description

This project is about writing a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. The smart contract is about my own token, minting and burning it. As well as tracking the token balance and managing the total supply of the account.

## Getting Started

### Executing the program

To get started, navigate to Remix - an online Solidity IDE, at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

* Create a new file in the `contracts` folder, then save the file with a `.sol` extension. Proceed to copy and paste the Solidity code available in this repository.

* To compile, navigate to the `Solidity compiler` tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure that the Compiler version is set to `0.8.27` (or other compatible version). Then, click the compile button.

* Navigate to the `Deploy & run transactions` tab, then proceed to click the `Deploy` button.

* After deployment, go to the `Deployed/Unpinned Contracts` section and proceed to interact with the available functions of the program.
